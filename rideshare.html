                My teammate and I developed the 
                website, while 3 other teammates worked on the backend and mobile app. As my contributions were primarily to 
                user research, project management, and front-end development, I focus mainly on these aspects in the following
                project summary. </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;" >What is 5-SURE?</h2>
        <p> 5-Sure Safe Rides, colloquially known as 5-SURE, is a phone call operated campus safety program that provides free transportation around Stanford's campus nearly every night from 5:00 pm - 2:00 am. 
            <br><br> 
            <b>Basically, 5-SURE is Stanford's free Uber.</b>
         </p>
         <h2>The Problem:</h2>
         <p>The problem is two-fold:</p>
         <div class="project-container">
            <p>
                <b>Student Passengers: </b> 
                <br>
                Currently, students must manually dial the 5-Sure phone number to speak to an operator. There is little transparency 
                in scheduling these rides; students often have to wait on hold, be called back multiple times, and may struggle to find 
                the exact location their driver is at.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>5-SURE Employees: </b> 
                <br>
                On the dispatch end, operators communicate via juggling phone calls, text messages, and walkie-talkies. During busy nights, 
                this process is extremely taxing to manage. Additionally,  some drivers are concerned with accuracy and safety; with a phone call system, 
                they are unsure if the strangers approaching them are the correct passengers.             
             </p>
         </div>
         <h2>Solution:</h2>
         <p>
            Thus, with 5-SURE's permission, we sought to develop an app for students to request rides with, eliminating the need for phone calls.
            This would ease the barrier to access for students, as well as streamline the ride dispatch process for 5-SURE employees. 
            
            After initial needfinding with employees, we also developed an accompanying website for the 5-SURE operators to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>User Interviews:</h2>
        <p>I interviewed two 5-SURE employees, the student manager and a dispatch operator, as well as three students, regular users of 5-SURE.
            As a student, I was familiar with many of the users' painpoints, but the information we gleaned from the 5-SURE employees was essential to understanding
            how to best support their needs.

            <div class="project-item">
                <p><b>Student Passengers... </b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Found phone calls to be annoying, especially in a loud environment like a party</li>
                    <li>Were frustrated by the lack of updates on their ride requests</li>
                    <li>Wanted more transparency on wait times, especially on busy weekend nights</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item">
                <p><b>5-SURE Employees... </b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feared that dispatch automation would affect job security; 5-SURE operators manage all ride requests and manually assign them to 2-3 drivers, allowing more students to be employed. </li>
                    <li>Prefers that drivers stay off their phone to maintain safety. Thus, the dispatcher must relay communication via walkie-talkies.</li>
                    <li>Felt discomfort approaching strangers late at night, as they only know the name and location of a passenger</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
         </div>
        <h2 >Prototyping and User Tests:</h2>
        <p>We conducted user tests with 4 individuals, a low-fi paper prototype and medium-fi Figma prototype for the rider and 5-SURE dispatch: </p>
        <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTytX-bVtmWlCh6MqyrKFKgFWzzRyOHQ4qSrlUqAoN46igPSVA0P_SocBEPvnT9ikjyMVOzfTLIeYLC/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=30000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;" >Final Website:</h2>
        <p>Through our findings from user interviews and user tests, we identified three key flows a 5-SURE dispatch operater would undergo
            to complete their work, viewing driver information, viewing the queue to assign and complete rides, and viewing the rides currently 
            in progress. My partner and I worked with the backend team to define API touchpoints with their database hosted by Postico such that
            we could pull the relevant information. Information would be posted to our database via ride requests from the app. </p>
        <h3>Driver Info:</h3>
        <img class="fullscreen-image" style="padding-bottom: 0px;" src="assets/images/project details/5sure-driver.png" alt="test">
        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Here, a dispatch operater could see all the information of the drivers on shift for the night, and contact information in case of emergencies</p>
        <h3>Queue:</h3>
        <img class="fullscreen-image" style="padding-bottom: 0px;" src="assets/images/project details/5sure-queue.png" alt="test">
        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">In this flow, dispatch can see the queue, view the rider's information, and assign a ride to an available driver. Only drivers
        not currently assigned to a passenger will appear to guard against errors. The queue is ordered by time to facilitate their FIFO fulfillment practice.</p>
        <h3>In Progress Rides:</h3>
        <img class="fullscreen-image" style="padding-bottom: 0px;" src="assets/images/project details/5sure-progress.png" alt="test">
        <p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">Dispatch operators may come to this flow to view the rides currently assigned to drivers. When the drivers update their progress via 
        walkie-talkies, dispatch can mark the driver as "arrived" or "completed" to send an update to the rider's app or become available for another ride.
        Confirmation pop-up screens prevent against accidental clicks.</p>

        <h2>Future Considerations:</h2>
        <p> Many of our project's features were limited due to class time constraints and 5-SURE's resources. 
            For example, we would have liked to include location based time estimates, but the cars were not equipped with location 
            capabilities and driver's were not supposed to be on their phones. Given more time and resources, we could consider:
            <ul>
                <li>Integrating with Stanford's IT, which could pull student's identifying information linked to login credentials rather than having dispatch manually input</li>
                <li>Developed better time estimations, whether that be through equiping cars with location capabilities or collecting longterm data to derive a more accurate algorithm</li>
                <li>Automating ride assigments, allowing those who would be in the dispatch role to be a driver if their were more cars available</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
