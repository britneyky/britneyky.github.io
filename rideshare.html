                My teammate and I developed the 
                website, while 3 other teammates worked on the backend and mobile app. As my contributions were primarily to 
                user research, project management, and front-end development, I focus mainly on these aspects in the following
                project summary. </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;" >What is 5-SURE?</h2>
        <p> 5-Sure Safe Rides, colloquially known as 5-SURE, is a phone call operated campus safety program that provides free transportation around Stanford's campus nearly every night from 5:00 pm - 2:00 am. 
            <br><br> 
            <b>Basically, 5-SURE is Stanford's free Uber.</b>
         </p>
         <h2>The Problem:</h2>
         <p>The problem is two-fold:</p>
         <div class="project-container">
            <p>
                <b>Student Passengers: </b> 
                <br>
                Currently, students must manually dial the 5-Sure phone number to speak to an operator. There is little transparency 
                in scheduling these rides; students often have to wait on hold, be called back multiple times, and may struggle to find 
                the exact location their driver is at.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>5-SURE Employees: </b> 
                <br>
                On the dispatch end, operators communicate via juggling phone calls, text messages, and walkie-talkies. During busy nights, 
                this process is extremely taxing to manage. Additionally,  some drivers are concerned with accuracy and safety; with a phone call system, 
                they are unsure if the strangers approaching them are the correct passengers.             
             </p>
         </div>
         <h2>Solution:</h2>
         <p>
            Thus, with 5-SURE's permission, we sought to develop an app for students to request rides with, eliminating the need for phone calls.
            This would ease the barrier to access for students, as well as streamline the ride dispatch process for 5-SURE employees. 
            
            After initial interviews with employees, we also developed an accompanying website for the 5-SURE operators to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>User Interviews:</h2>
        <p>I interviewed two 5-SURE employees, the student manager and a dispatch operator, as well as three students, regular users of 5-SURE.
            As a student, I was familiar with many of the users' painpoints, but the

                    <li>phone calls are annoying, especially in a loud environment like a party or when they don't feel safe </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>job security. 5-SURE operators manually handle all aspects of ride dispatch (maintaining queue, assigning rides, phone calls, etc.)</li>
                    <li>location mix ups</li>
                    <li>5-SURE prefers that drivers not have the app to stay off their phone as it is a safety issue. They would rather the dispatcher relay communication.</li>
                    <li>late nights... picking up strangers</li>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;" >Key Findings:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Minimize amount of clicks on dispatch</li>
                <li> Finalize informaiton is displayed</li>
                <li> Phone app was straightforward to use as there are minimal interactions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Final Website:</h2>
        <p>Through our findings from user interviews and user tests, we identified three key flows a 5-SURE dispatch operater would undergo
            to complete their work, viewing driver information, viewing the queue to assign and complete rides, and viewing the rides currently 
            in progress. My partner and I worked with the backend team to define API touchpoints with their database hosted by Postico such that
            we could pull the relevant information. </p>

                <li>Entered in information to the database, but if this were integrated with Stanford's system, could pull identifying infromation linked to login credentials</li>
                <li>Better time estimations, whether that be through equiping cars with location capabilities or collecting longterm data to derive a more accurate algorithm</li>
